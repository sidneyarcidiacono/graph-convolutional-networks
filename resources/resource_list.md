## Graph Convolutional Networks - What are they?

[Graph Convolutional Networks, Thomas Kipf](https://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/)

Kipf's article discusses the two following papers:

  1. Kipf & Welling (ICLR 2017), [Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907)
  2. Defferrard et al. (NIPS 2016), [Convolutional Neural Networks on Graphs with Fast Localized Spectral Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09375)

  As well as a review/discussion post by Ferenc Huszar called [How Powerful are Graph Convolutions?](http://www.inference.vc/how-powerful-are-graph-convolutions-review-of-kipf-welling-2016-2/)
